You turn to the distance: a man's red hand stabs the ground with a boot at his feet. Face bitten with frost, he digs at the ice with the end of the steel-capped tip. Who know and do not know him don't try to speak, they see in his eyes he will die soon. You look at the ice, reflecting the sky, to see what it is that he breaks for. A shimmering flicker of glimmering light. A fire. Below. You break for it.;top_left;;clear;5;white;text;;8;;no_sound;no_block;hold",
